Here I share resources I found helpful to understand fundamental concepts of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

## Data Preprocessing
* [Preprocessing for deep learning: from covariance matrix to image whitening](https://hadrienj.github.io/posts/Preprocessing-for-deep-learning/)


## Dealing with difficulties of generating image with GAN
* [Deconvolution and Checkerboard Artifacts](https://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/)
